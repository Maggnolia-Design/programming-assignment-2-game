Game for Programming Basics Class 2


Come up with an idea for a game then write a little bit about it in your readme.md. You do not need to make this game. Just come up with an idea.

-Game starts with a square and a circle growing within it
-when you click, the circle shrinks by a little
-you must click as fast as you can to shrink the circle down the the smallest possible size to clear the level
-at each level, the square gets smaller (=less time to clear the level)
-if the circle hits the borders of the square you lose
-cool graphic effects on the circle or the square to make it look more cool (like fading/flickering rings or light?)
